[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Sirius-A/sv-restaurant-zug-bot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Sirius-A/sv-restaurant-zug-bot) 

A Telegram bot to retrieve the menu of the SV restaurant in Zug (called Five Moods).

# Try it 
Add the bot using http://telegram.me/FiveMoodsBot and call `/get@FiveMoodsBot` to receive today's menu.

If you want the bot to send you the menu regularly, try  `/getDaily@FiveMoodsBot` or `/getPartTime@FiveMoodsBot`.

# Develop
1. To host a similar bot like this, clone this repo:

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:Sirius-A/sv-restaurant-zug-bot.git
    ```

2. Install all packages with

    ```
    $ yarn
    ```

3. To start the bot you will need an Telegram API token. Talk to the [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather) for that.
    Once you received your token, pass to the `BOT_API_TOKEN` environment variable. 
    This can be done in the run config of your IDE or directly in the console.

    ```
    $ BOT_API_TOKEN='MY_SUP3R:SEC|2ET_4PI_T0K3N' yarn start
    ```
    **Note:** This bot also uses 2 more environment variables.
     - `MONGODB_URI` as a connection string to mongoDB, where the subscriptions are stored.
     - `BOT_USERNAME` the username of the bot, used to add its handle when listing the bot command.

5. Once youâ€™re satisfied with the behavior, commit all your files and deploy the app to a node.js provider of your choice.
Below are the steps required for [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

    ```
    $ heroku create five-moods-telegram-bot --region eu
    Creating five-moods-telegram-bot... done, region is eu
    
    $ heroku config:set BOT_API_TOKEN=MY_SUP3R:SEC|2ET_4PI_T0K3N
    Setting BOT_API_TOKEN and restarting five-moods-telegram-bot... done, v6
    
    $ heroku git:remote -a five-moods-telegram-bot
    
    $ git push heroku main
    ```

6. Run the following command to avoid the error log message `Error R10 (Boot timeout) -> Web process failed to bind to $PORT within 60 seconds of launch`:

    ```
    $ heroku scale web=0 worker=1
    ```
